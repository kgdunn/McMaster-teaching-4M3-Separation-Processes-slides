\begin{frame}\frametitle{Final exam details}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	On Monday, 10 December 2012
		\item	12:30 to 15:30
		\item	Building T-28
		\item	It will likely be around 100 marks
		\item	As we discussed previously, the number of questions you see is immaterial
		\item	The question style will be mostly conceptual
		\item	You can be sure there will be 100\% coverage of the topics
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{24pt}
	\textbf{Please note}: \emph{I've not set the final exam yet}, so please do not interpret anything from this lecture as being more/less important.

	\begin{exampleblock}{What's in the exam?}
		Everything that was covered in class time
	\end{exampleblock}
	\vspace{24pt}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Guest lecture
		\item	Course presentations
		\item	My lectures
		\item	``Interactive tutorial-type'' classes (i.e. Friday classes)
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{To bring to the exam}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\textbf{Psychrometric chart}: available on course website. \emph{It will not be provided}, and it will be required.
		\item	Any notes, assignments, midterms, \emph{etc} that you will feel are helpful
		\item	Any textbooks and printed materials
	\end{itemize}
	Only limitation: no iPads, tablets, electronic devices
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{How to do well in the final exam}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Review the midterm without solutions: \emph{{\color{myOrange}{it should be easy now}}}
		\item	Redo assignment questions you got wrong
		\item	More importantly: understand \textbf{why} you initially got the question wrong
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	what concept did you misunderstand?
				\item	take time to review that concept(s) again
			\end{itemize}
		\item	Review questions from Geankoplis and from Seader \emph{et al.}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{What can I do to prepare?}
	\textbf{{\color{myGreen}{\emph{Some tips from the educational research area:}}}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Don't look at a question/topic and say: ``Yeah, I can do that''. Prove that you can.
		\item	While you are learning check/ask yourself whether you actually understand that topic.
		\item	Can you explain the concept to a study partner without looking at the notes?
		\item	Can you explain \textbf{the approach} you would take to solve a problem?
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{{\color{myRed}{Poor students do this*}}}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Distractions: study with music, cellphones and email/website checking, TV on in background
		\item	Skip over parts you don't understand
		\item	After finishing, try to repeat text literally
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Why study this course: Separation Processes?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Can't beat Nature: ``Second Law of Thermodynamics''
		\item	There are multiple ways to achieve a required separation
		\item	50\% to 90\% of capital investment on petroleum and other chemical-reaction based flowsheets 
		\item	Expense often in proportion to the level of purity (called the separation factor) %\see{Treybal, p 2}
		\item	60 to 100\% of the ongoing operating costs in chemical plants  % Reference for this? Uhlmann overview PDF?
		\item	These systems are all around us
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	leaching (coffee)
			\item	centrifugation and drying (washing and tumble drying clothes)
			\item	absorption (your lungs)
			\item	membranes (your skin, kidneys)
			\item	adsorption (water filter)
		\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Common themes in all sections}

		\item	Separation factor = $S_{ij} = \displaystyle \frac{x_{i,1} / x_{j,1}}{x_{i,2} / x_{j,2}}$
		\item	Concentration of recovered compound in stream $i$
		\item	Recovery = $\displaystyle\frac{\text{mass of desired compound recovered in stream~} i}{\text{mass of desired compound in all other streams}}$
		\item	Separating agents: mass (MSA) and energy (ESA)
		\item	Which phases are involved?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Take the following into account}
	For each separator we looked at, {\color{myOrange}{please aim to}}:
	\vspace{12pt}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	understand the \textbf{physical principle} used in the separation
		\item	know which \textbf{phases} are present and being separated?
		\item	determine what affects the \textbf{unit's cost}?
		\item	\textbf{identify variables} when troubleshooting problems with the unit
		\item	optimize an existing unit: increase throughput, boost recovery, aka ``intensification''
		\item	\textbf{repurpose} an existing unit for a similar, but different use.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Other tips}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Understand the concepts being learned. My courses are not about applying the correct equation and solving.
		\item	Read the questions carefully: they are worded precisely. Answer all parts of the questions.
		\item	None of the final exam questions are going to be from the assignments (even with different values).
		\item	Check that your answers are reasonable (can you really have a flow rate of 1050 \(\text{m}^3.\text{s}^{-1}\) through a pipe?)
		\item	Computer questions in assignments: make sure you can repeat them by hand, where reasonable.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{exampleblock}{{\color{myRed}{Most important advice}}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Treat the exam as a closed-book test: have a formula sheet for the equations, and understand all the concepts without referring to a textbook
			\item	Textbooks and other papers should be used to refer to as a backup only.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Thank you}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	It's been a long semester, \textbf{\emph{really busy}}
		\item	You've been the guinea pigs for this 4M3 overhaul.
		\item	In addition to it being my first time teaching this topic.
		\item	Endured late midterms -- 6 weeks -- \emph{yikes!} Sorry about that.
		\item	But you have helped me tremendously with feedback about the notes and good questions in class and by email.
		\item	Further comments? \href{https://evals.mcmaster.ca}{https://evals.mcmaster.ca} or in person.
	\end{itemize}
