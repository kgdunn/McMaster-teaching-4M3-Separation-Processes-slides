	Perry's section 22.5.8

	EPA has compiled significant data on values of k and n for environmentally significant pollutants with typical activated carbons. Assuming equilibrium is reached, the isotherm provides the dose of carbon required for treatment. In a concurrent contacting process, the capacity is set by the required effluent concentration. In a countercurrent process, the capacity of the carbon is set by the untreated waste pollutant concentration. Thus countercurrent contacting is preferred.

	Activated carbon is available in powdered form (200-400 mesh) and granular form (10-40 mesh). The latter is more expensive but is easier to regenerate and easier to utilize in a countercurrent contactor. Powdered carbon is applied in well-mixed slurry-type contactors for detention times of several hours after which separation from the flow occurs by sedimentation. Often coagulation, flocculation, and filtration are required in addition to sedimentation. As it is difficult to regenerate, powdered carbon is usually discarded after use. Granular carbon is used in column contactors with EBCT of 30 minutes to 1 hour. Often several contactors are used in series, providing for full countercurrent contact. A single contactor will provide only partial countercurrent contact. When a contactor is exhausted, the carbon is regenerated either by a thermal method or by passing a solvent through the contactor. For waste-treatment applications where a large number of pollutants must be removed but the quantity of each pollutant is small, thermal regeneration is favored. In situations where a single pollutant in large quantity is removed by the carbon, solvent extraction regeneration can be used, especially where the pollutant can be recovered from the solvent and reused. Thermal regeneration is a complex operation. It requires removal of the carbon from the contactor, drainage of free water, transport to a furnace, heating under controlled conditions of temperature, oxygen, time, water vapor partial pressure, quenching, transport back to the reactor, and reloading of the column. Five to ten percent of the carbon is lost in this regeneration process due to burning and attrition during each regeneration cycle. Multiple hearth, rotary kiln, and fluidized bed furnaces have all been successfully used for carbon regeneration.

	Pretreatment prior to carbon adsorption is usually for removal of suspended solids. Often this process is used as tertiary treatment after primary and biological treatment. In either situation, the carbon columns must be designed to provide for backwash. Some solids will escape pretreatment, and biological growth will occur on the carbon, even with extensive pretreatment. Originally carbon treatment was viewed only as applicable for removal of toxic organics or those that are difficult to degrade biologically. Present practice applies carbon adsorption as a procedure for removal of all types of organics. It is realized that some biological activity will occur in virtually any activated carbon unit, so the design must be adjusted accordingly.

	Note that the equilibrium section is where the isotherm applies: C_{A,S} = fn (C_A). We measure C_A, so we can calculate C_{A,S} = (kg adsorbate)/(adsorbent)
	Then if we know how much adsorbate I need to remove in a given time (theta_B)

		% Details on this slide are from Schweitzer, p 3-23
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Adsorbent information from vendors is published in terms of the dynamic or breakthrough capacity of a bed, for a given feed concentration.
			\item	It is clear from the MTZ concept, that the bed must at least exceed the length of the MTZ.
		\end{itemize}

		\vspace{12pt}
		MTZ is affected by
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	type of adsorbent
			\item	particle size distribution
			\item	fluid velocity through bed
			\item	operating temperature (adjusts isotherm, which affects MTZ shape)
			\item	concentration of contaminants
		\end{itemize}

		$t_b = \frac{as}{C_0 Q}\left(L-h\right)$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	$L$ = bed length [m]
			\item	$h$ = half-length of the MTZ [m]
			\item	$Q$ = volumetric flow rate [$m^3$/s]
			\item	$t_b$ = breakthrough time [s]
			\item	$s$ = cross section of the adsorbent bed [$m^2$]
			\item	$a$ = volumetric adsorption capacity at $c_0$ [$m^3/m^3 ??????$] = $C_{A,S} [kg/kg]$
			\item	$C_0$ = adsorbate volume fraction $[m^3/m^3]  C_{A,feed} = kg/m^3$

\begin{frame}\frametitle{When to consider adsorption}
	Distillation, membranes, absorption, liquid-liquid extraction are sometimes viable alternatives.

	\vspace{12pt}
	But adsorption is considered when:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	relative volatility between components is $<1.5$ (e.g. isomers)
		\item	large reflux ratios would be required
		\item	excessive temperatures or high pressure drops are to be avoided
		\item	too large area for a membrane
		\item	high selectivity is required
		\item	feed is a very dilute stream of solute (adsorbate)
	\end{itemize}
	But, some disadvantages:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	only the surface of the adsorbent used
		\item	regeneration of MSA adsorbent required
		\item	MSA will break down mechanically over time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	{\color{myOrange}{we can pump it, filter it, and/or put it through cyclones}}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Quantifying the adsorbent}
	\seefull{Perry's, Ch 22}: A fixed bed of porous adsorbent material. Bulk density is 500 kg.m$^{-3}$, and the {\color{purple}{interparticle}} [between] void fraction is 0.40. The {\color{purple}{intraparticle}} [within] porosity is 0.50, with two-thirds of this in cylindrical pores of diameter 1.4 nm and the rest in much larger pores. \textbf{Find}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	surface area of the adsorbent
		\item	if solute has formed a complete {\color{purple}{monomolecular layer}} 0.3 nm thick inside the pores, determine the percent of the particle volume and the percent of the total bed volume filled with adsorbate.
	\end{itemize}

	\vspace{12pt}
	\emph{Solution}:
	Assume from surface area to volume ratio that the internal area is practically all in the small pores [ignore large pores].
	One gram of the adsorbent occupies 2cm$^3$ as packed and has 0.4cm$^3$ in small pores, which gives a surface area of 1150 m$^2$/gram {\scriptsize (university stadium field area $\sim 5000~\text{to}~8000 \text{m}^2$)}.
	Based on the area of the annular region filled with adsorbate, the solute occupies 22.5\% of internal pore volume and 13.5\% of the total packed-bed volume.

	% Over 100 commercial installations
	% It simulates counter-current operation,since true counter-current operation is not possible without axial mixing and damage to the adsorbent, this approach works very well.

	% From Rousseau:

	% The problems associated with moving-bed processes have been solved by the development of the simulated moving bed.
	% This process, the bed is maintained stationary, and the feed and the displacement-liquid inlets and the two product outlets are moved as a function of time. In addition, the displacement liquid is continuously circulated by a pump from the bottom to the top of the bed. The most widely used version of this scheme is the Sorbex process, developed by Universal Oil Products, Inc. (UOP). A schematic diagram is given in Fig. 12.5-10. The lines shown as open are 2, 5, 9, and 12. After a short period of time each of the first three streams is moved to the next-higher-number point by the rotary valve. The less-adsorbed product line is switched from 12 to 1. During subsequent time periods the four lines are moved in the same manner. A more detailed description is given in Ref. 26.
	% Other versions of the simulated moving-bed process have been commercialized by Toray Industries,
	% This process can also be thought of as a variation of a displacement-purge cycle. In this
	% 27 28 29 Inc. ' and Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Ltd.
	% These processes vary from the Sorbex technology in
	% details rather than in their basic concept.
	% Although simulated moving-bed processes have now reached wide commercial acceptance for a number
	% of separations, the need for a displacement liquid, which must subsequently be distilled from both product streams, constitutes a process complexity and an economic hindrance. For this reason, applications of these processes have been confined to those separations that are difficult or impossible to make by distillation.
	% The separation of fructose and glucose via simulated moving-bed adsorption is an example, like IsoSiv in the Total Isomerization Process for isoparaffin production, of the close coupling of reaction and separation systems. Glucose, which can be obtained from hydrolysis of starch, is isomerized to a near-equilibrium mixture of fructose and glucose (high-fructose corn syrup, HFCS). The resulting mixture can then be further enriched in fructose while also producing a glucose stream for recycle to isomerization. HFCS, because it rivals sucrose (cane sugar) in sweetness, is finding rapidly growing uses in beverages, candies, baking products, and so on.

	We aren't always sure which isotherm fits a given adsorbate-adsorbent pair:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	Perform a laboratory experiment to collect the data
		\item	Postulate a model (e.g. linear, or Langmuir)
		\item	Fit the model to the data
		\item	Good fit?
	\end{enumerate}

	\vspace{24pt}
	Other isotherms have been proposed:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) isotherm
		\item	Gibb's isotherm: allows for a multilayer of adsorbate forming
	\end{itemize}

	These are far more flexible models (more parameters); e.g. Langmuir isotherm is a special case of the BET isotherm.

		\item	often leave some residual adsorbate behind, since time to completely strip adsorbent of it would be excessive
		\item	care must be taken with flammable adsorbates:

			\item	stripping temperatures are high

	You are to design a batch adsorber to remove an organic contaminant (A) from 400L of aqueous solution containing 0.05g/L of the contaminant. To facilitate this you do a bench scale experiment with 1L solution at the same concentration (0.05g/L) and 3g of an adsorbent. In the bench scale experiment you find that 96\% of the contaminant was removed. You need to remove 99\% of the contaminant in the full scale apparatus. You can assume that a linear isotherm applies.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	How much adsorbent do you need?

	Trimethylethylene (TME) is being removed from an aqueous chemical plant waste stream. A bench scale system indicates that an adsorbent follows a Langmuir adsorption isotherm as:
	\[
		C_\text{A,S} = \frac{0.05C_\text{A}}{32.1 + C_\text{A}}
	\]
	where $C_\text{A,S}$ has units of [grams/grams], and the constant has units of 32.1 ppm. In a {\color{myRed}{\sout{batch}}} tank we have an inlet flow of TME solution at 10L/min with density of 1000$\text{kg.m}^{-3}$. The TME enters at 100 ppm (parts per million, mass solute per $10^6$ mass solution) in the feed. The impurity is not detectable below 1ppm concentrations. The tank contains 15kg of initially fresh adsorbent which is retained in the tank. We wish to know:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	How much TME is adsorbed when the breakthrough concentration reaches 1 ppm? [{\color{myOrange}{Ans: 22.65kg}}]
