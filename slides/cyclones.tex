Crushing circuit: to separate fines from coarse: recycle coarse material for recrushing. Could also use a screen. Why use a cyclone instead?
Also: could use elutriation with air rather than screens or cyclones. Why would you use elutriation?

Use: to clean dust from air; generally 5\mu m and large
Use: mists separated from gas

A cyclone is a centrifugal elutriator, although it is not usually so regarded. The cyclosizer is a series of inverted cyclones with added apex chambers through which water flows. Suspension is fed into the largest cyclone, and particles are separated into different size ranges.

Question: can you operate a cyclone upside down or rotated at any angle for that matter?

Question: could you run a cyclone fully loaded with liquid and solid to separate them? i.e. replace your fluid phase from a gas (air) to a liquid (water)
