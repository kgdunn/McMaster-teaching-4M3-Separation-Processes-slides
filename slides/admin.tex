\begin{frame}\frametitle{Grading}
	What we look for in the grading is demonstration that you/group:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	understand the concept
		\item	have the ability to apply the concept to new instances
		\item	think creatively about problems
		\item	accuracy.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Grading}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
		Assignments (about 5)       	& 20\% \\
	    Written midterm        			& 15\% \\
	    Mid/end term take-home exam		& 10\% \\
	    Project, including a short class presentation& 10\% \\
	    Final exam 						& 45\% \\
	\end{tabular}
	
	\vspace{12pt}
	\vspace{12pt}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\emph{Grading allocation is subject to change}
		\item	Course letters will be assigned using standard system
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Group-based assignments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	``Appropriate'' group work is highly encouraged (about 40\% of course)
		\item	Learn with each other: groups of 2, no larger
		\hrule
		\item	Optimal group work: \emph{an example of one approach}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	Sarah and Brad work on an assignment
				\item	Both Sarah and Brad do {\color{myRed}{\textbf{all questions}}} in draft: quick notes at home, \emph{etc}, $\pm 4$ days before assignment due
				\item	Meet in the library and go over each other's notes
				\item	Explain to the other why you disagree
				\item	e.g. Sarah sees a mistaken interpretation in Brad's work
				\begin{itemize}
					\item	She explains why it is a mistake to Brad: Sarah learns
					\item	Brad also learns: he's heard this in class, and from Sarah now
					\item	If neither can resolve it? speak with TA or intructor					
				\end{itemize}
				\item	Write up a joint solution; e.g. Sarah does Q1 and 2, Brad does Q3
				\item	Both review it before submitting
			\end{itemize}
		\hrule
		\item	Other approaches are possible: you discuss what works
		\item	\color{myOrange}{What doesn't work}: Sarah does Q1 and Q2, Brad does Q3; staple and submit
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Midterms and exam}

		\item	Written midterm: 18 October, 18:30

	For each one, please list:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	Why you are interested in it
