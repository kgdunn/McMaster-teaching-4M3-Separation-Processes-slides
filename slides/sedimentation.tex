In wastewater treatment: Perry's section 22.5.6

Gravity Sedimentation Slowly settling particles are removed with gravity sedimentation tanks. For the most part,  A sedimentation tank can be rectangular or circular. The important factor affecting its removal efficiency is the hydraulic flow pattern through the tank. The energy contained in the incoming-wastewater flow must be dissipated before the solids can settle. The wastewater flow must be distributed properly through the sedimentation volume for maximum settling efficiency. After the solids have settled, the settled effluent should be collected without creating serious hydraulic currents that could adversely affect the sedimentation process. Effluent weirs are placed at the end of rectangular sedimentation tanks and around the periphery of circular sedimentation tanks to ensure uniform flow out of the tanks. Once the solids have settled, they must be removed from the sedimentation-tank floor by scraping and hydraulic flow. Conventional sedimentation tanks have sludge hoppers to collect the concentrated sludge and to prevent removal of excess volumes of water with the settled solids. Cross-sectional diagrams of conventional sedimentation tanks are shown in Figs. 22-32 and 22-33.

Design criteria for gravity sedimentation tanks normally provide for 2-h retention based on average flow, with longer retention periods used for light solids or inert solids that do not change during their retention in the tank. Care should be taken that sedimentation time is not too long; otherwise, the solids will compact too densely and affect solids collection and removal. Organic solids generally will not compact to more than 5 to 10 percent. Inorganic solids will compact up to 20 or 30 percent. Centrifugal sludge pumps can handle solids up to 5 or 6 percent, while positive-displacement sludge pumps can handle solids up to 10 percent. With solids above 10 percent the sludge tends to lose fluid properties and must be handled as a semi-solid rather than a fluid. Circular sedimentation tanks have steel truss boxes with angled sludge scrapers on the lower side. As the sludge scrapers rotate, the solids are pushed toward the sludge hopper for removal on a continuous or semicontinuous basis. The rectangular sedimentation tanks employ chain-and-flight sludge collectors or rail-mounted sludge collectors. When floating solids can occur in primary sedimentation tanks, surface skimmers are mounted on the sludge scrapers so that the surface solids are removed at regular intervals.


Figure 22-32. Schematic diagram of a circular sedimentation tank.

Figure 22-33. Schematic diagram of a rectangular sedimentation tank.
The surface overflow rate (SOR) for primary sedimentation is normally held close to 40.74 m 3/(m 2·day) [1000 gal/(ft 2·day)] for average flow rates, depending upon the solids characteristics. Lowering the SOR below 40.74 m 3/(m 2·day) does not produce improved effluent quality in proportion to the reduction in SOR. Generally, the minimum depth of sedimentation tanks is 3.0 m (10 ft), with circular sedimentation tanks having a minimum diameter of 6.0 m (20 ft) and rectangular sedimentation tanks having length-to-width ratios of 5:1. Chain-and-flight limitations generally keep the width of rectangular sedimentation tanks to increments of 6.0 m (20 ft) or less. While hydraulic overflow rates have been limited on the effluent weirs, operating experience has indicated that the recommended limit of 186 m 3/ (m·day) [15,000 gal/(ft·day)] is lower than necessary for good operation. A circular sedimentation tank with a single-edge weir provides adequate weir length and is easier to adjust than one with a doublesided weir. More problems appear to be created from improper adjustment of the effluent weirs than from improper length.


And Perry's section 22.5.7

edimentation Tanks These tanks are an integral part of any activated-sludge system. It is essential to separate the suspended solids from the treated liquid if a high-quality effluent is to be produced. Circular sedimentation tanks with various types of hydraulic sludge collectors have become the standard secondary sedimentation system. Square tanks have been used with commonwall construction for compact design with multiple tanks. Most secondary sedimentation tanks use center-feed inlets and peripheral-weir outlets. Recently, efforts have been made to employ peripheral inlets with submerged-orifice flow controllers and either center-weir outlets or peripheral-weir outlets adjacent to the peripheral-inlet channel.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Definitions}	
	\textbf{Sedimentation}
	\begin{quote}	
		Removal of suspended solid particles from a fluid (\textbf{liquid} or gas) stream by gravitational settling.
	\end{quote}
	Most common to use a \textbf{liquid} rather than gas phase.

	\vspace{12pt}
	Some semantics:
	
	\vspace{12pt}	
	{\color{myGreen}{Thickening}}: generally aims to increase the solids to higher concentration; higher throughput processes

	\vspace{12pt}
	{\color{myGreen}{Clarification}}: remove solids from a relatively dilute stream, usually aims for complete suspended-solids removal: units are deeper, and have provision for coagulation of feed.

		\item	concentrated feeds: modify the apparent density and viscosity of the fluid
		\item	upward velocity of displaced fluids
		\item	small particles are dragged in the wake of larger particles
